# Learnora — Mock Data & Supabase Connectivity Audit

**Date:** 2026-06-09  
**Scope:** Every interactive element and data display, every role  
**Goal:** Know exactly what's live vs mock before wiring anything

---

## Status Key
| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| ✅ | Connected — live Supabase query confirmed |
| ⚠️ | Partial — some data live, some still mock |
| ❌ | Mock — no Supabase calls; UI only |

## Priority Key
| Tag | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| 🔴 MVP | Product can't function without this |
| 🟡 Soon | Needed within first month of real use |
| ⚪ Later | Advanced/nice-to-have; fine to stay mock for now |

## Tables NOT in schema
`audit_logs`, `email_templates`, `quiz_questions` — these don't exist yet; pages that depend on them are flagged.
